👍 🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! We're really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteers to help the wiki come to fruition. 👍 🎉 

# Important resources:

* There is a SpineModel slack group ([spinemodel.slack.com](https://spinemodel.slack.com/)). [Send us an email to get invited](mailto:spine@driven.email?subject=Please add me to the SpineModel Slack Group&body=Thanks!).
* You can follow [@spinemodel on twitter](http://www.twitter.com/spinemodel).
* If you're familiar with GitHub, [the repository for this site is here](https://github.com/SpineWiki/spinewiki.github.io).
* If you'd like to send us an email directly, use [spine@driven.email](mailto:spine@driven.email).

# Did you find a bug/mistake/broken link?

Please report it via [spine@driven.email](mailto:spine@driven.email).

# Do you intend to add a new page or change an existing one?

## Easiest Way
[Email your contribution to us](mailto:spine@driven.email). The preferred format is [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), but any text format is accepted (Word, Pdf, even plain text in your email). We'll credit you on the page(s) you contribute to.

## For those familiar with using GitHub and Jekyll
Spine.wiki is a static [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site.

You add new pages by creating a new markdown file in the _posts folder on the *develop* branch (master branch contains the generated site, develop branch has the raw files). Starting from a copy of an existing file is easiest. 

Fork the [spine.wiki repo from GitHub](https://github.com/SpineWiki/spinewiki.github.io) and send a pull request with your contribution. 

# Style Conventions
Spine.wiki has been developed with the following values, keep them in mind when contributing:

* *Precise* - Short, concise descriptions of various parts of Spine Models.
* *Simple* - Avoid jargon where plain language will do. 
* *Shallow* - Create a map, not an archive. Rather than duplicating content from other sources, add the relevant snippet and link to the source.

# Welcome!
Spine.wiki is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and [join the team](https://spinemodel.slack.com/x-172600838673-172600869697/signup)!

Thanks! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
